# Distance Tests

This test is used to test if the Branch distance for a statement in the else branch of a condition with an if statement
is calculated correctly. At the first click the distance for the statement with id 'BU3Tbd}3|0N2jVOj/Sf.' is expected
to be 1, and after the second click event is applied the distance should be 0.

Currently this has to be viewed in the debugger or logs and can be tested by using Chromosomes of Length 1 and 2 in
separate runs.
